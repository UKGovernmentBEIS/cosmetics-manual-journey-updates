      EU notification files
    </h1>
    <p>
      To notify your products you can use data from an EU notification or give the information manually. Using the data from your EU notification means you need to answer fewer questions and you can upload up to 100 at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data from your EU notification must be in the same format as a ZIP file exported from CPNP.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use an EU notification file regardless of whether the product was notified before Brexit or not.
    </p>
