      <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-2'>You need to tell us about all the nanomaterials used in your cosmetic product.</p>

      <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-4'>How you do this depends on whether the substance is listed as a colourant, preservative or UV filter in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/endocrine_disruptors/docs/cosmetic_1223_2009_regulation_en.pdf">EC Regulation 1223/2009 (Annex 4, 5 or 6)</a>.</p>


      <h2 class='govuk-heading-m'>Substances listed in EC Regulation 1223/2009</h2>

      <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-2'>If the substance is listed in EC Regulation 1223/2009, you can tell us about the nanomaterial when you notify us about the cosmetic product.</p>

      <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-3'>You'll need to tell us the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) name of each substance.</p>

      <h2 class='govuk-heading-m'>Substances not listed in EC Regulation 1223/2009</h2>

      <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-2'>If the substance is not listed in EC Regulation 1223/2009, or not used in a standard way, you'll need to give us more information about the nanomaterial <strong>before</strong> you can notify us about the cosmetic product.</p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">You'll need to send a PDF to <a href ="mailto:">nanomaterial-review-panel@beis.gov.uk</a> listing the nanomaterials.</div>

    <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-2'>For each nanomaterial, you'll need to tell us:</p>

    <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
    <li>the quantity expected to be placed on the market each year</li>
    <li>the specification, including the size of particles, physical and chemical properties</li>
    <li>the droplet size and distribution when sprayed</li>
    <li>the toxicological profile</li>
    <li>the safety data relating to the category of products in which it will be used</li>
    <li>whether it reacts or changes its properties in certain conditions, for example if it's photocatalytic</li>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">You'll also need to tell us the email address of someone to contact about the nanomaterials.</div>
