        Multi-item kits
      </h1>
      <p>
        Multi-item kits are composed of items that are not marketed separately. They are sold as a kit and intended to be used as a mix or sequentially.
      </p>
      <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-1'>
        Examples of multi-component cosmetics include:
      </p>
      <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
        <li>hair dye sets</li>
        <li>skin peeling kits</li>
        <li>permanent styling products</li>
        <li>anti-age or revitalising kits</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If the cosmetic product is sold as a gift set where the components are not mixed or used sequentially, submit a notification for each product separately.
